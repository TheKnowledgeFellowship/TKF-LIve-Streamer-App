# TKF-LIve-Streamer-App
A simple processing sketch that checks a list of twitch streamers and tells you who is live
Based on 314R-Salles processing app just trimmed down. https://github.com/314R-Salles
Change the names in the streamer list to check other streamers. 
The twitch app code works but if it's used too much it will break so put your own twitch app auth code for it to be reliable.
